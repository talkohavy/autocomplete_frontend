# Getting Started with AutoComplete_Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
An app that presents an autocomplete TextField that fetches a partial list of words starting with the typed-in text entered by the user. The component mimics the behavior of the well-known library called Material-UI.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
It automatically opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your browser, and displays the home page of the app.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Learn More

The code presented in this project is 50% out of the full project. For it to be able to run, you need to have both repositories: autocomplete_frontend & autocomplete_backend. You can view the other half over at [AutoComplete_Backend](https://https://github.com/talkohavy/autocomplete_backend).

The frontend was executed with Create React App, and therefore, no .env were used for the Frontend part of the app.

### Deployment

Since this app was created with Create React App, to deploy it means to serve it as static. This could easily be done in so many ways. I recommend checking out Express for that.
